# SortingVisualizer

This is a sorting visualizer made using Python and Pygame: 

It allows the user to select between heap sort, quick sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort. The heap sort function only sorts in ascending order, with a max heap. The quick sort function uses the median of 3 method to find its next pivot.  

Here is the basic UI of the Visualizer 

Here is how the bars look mid-sorting
